## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of capabilities in data analysis, business intelligence, and AI integration, presented as a portfolio piece. It features a comprehensive marketing dashboard built with **Power BI**, leveraging insights generated by **Google's Gemini API** from a mock dataset.

The dashboard provides an analysis of marketing campaign performance, user engagement funnels, and specific insights derived from simulated user interactions and feedback, such as:
*   Return on Investment (ROI) by campaign.
*   Lead generation趋势 and Cost Per Lead (CPL).
*   Conversion rates by channel.
*   User acquisition funnels (Site Visits, Content Views, Searches, RFQs Submitted).
*   Analysis of Request for Quotations (RFQs), including service type and implied urgency, powered by Gemini.
*   Sentiment analysis of (mock) user feedback, also powered by Gemini.

**Disclaimer:** The data used in this project is entirely **mock data**, generated programmaTically for demonstration purposes. It does **not** represent real data or performance metrics of Thomasnet (A Xometry Company) or any other actual company. The company logo is used for illustrative context only. This project serves as a preview to showcase technical skills in integrating Power BI with advanced AI models like Gemini for enhanced data storytelling.

## Key Features & Skills Demonstrated

*   **Data Pipeline & ETL:**
    *   Python scripts for generating a structured, relational mock dataset (`thomas_data.py`) emulating marketing campaigns, user details, and user interactions.
    *   Python script for interacting with the Google Gemini API (`enrich_with_gemini.py`) to process textual data (e.g., RFQ details, user feedback) and generate structured AI insights (e.g., service categorization, sentiment analysis, keyword extraction).
*   **AI Integration (Google Gemini API):**
    *   Crafting effective prompts for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.
    *   Parsing and integrating JSON responses from the Gemini API into a data pipeline.
    *   Managing API calls, including rate limiting considerations.
*   **Business Intelligence & Data Visualization (Power BI):**
    *   Developing an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
    *   Creating insightful KPIs, charts (bar, line, funnel, map, treemap for urgency/type), and tables.
    *   Data modeling within Power BI.
    *   Utilizing Power Query for data transformation, including parsing JSON data from AI model outputs.
*   **Python for Data Science:**
    *   Proficiency in `pandas` for data manipulation.
    *   Use of `google-generativeai` library for API interaction.
    *   Scripting for automation and data processing.
*   **Version Control:**
    *   Project managed with Git and hosted on GitHub.

## Technical Stack

*   **Dashboarding:** Microsoft Power BI Desktop
*   **AI Model:** Google Gemini API (e.g., `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`)
*   **Data Generation & API Interaction:** Python 3.x
    *   Libraries: `pandas`, `google-generativeai`, `python-dotenv`
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   Power BI Desktop
*   Git (for cloning)
*   A Google Gemini API Key (from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/))

### Local Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SEU_NOME_DE_USUARIO/NOME_DO_SEU_REPOSITORIO.git
    cd NOME_DO_SEU_REPOSITORIO
    ```
2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas google-generativeai python-dotenv
    ```
3.  **Set up API Key:**
    *   Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
    *   Open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=SUA_API_KEY_AQUI
        ```
4.  **Generate Mock Data (Optional - Enriched CSVs may be provided):**
    If you want to regenerate the base mock data:
    ```bash
    python thomas_data.py
    ```
    This will create `campaign_details.csv`, `user_details.csv`, and `marketing_interactions.csv`.

5.  **Enrich Data with Gemini API:**
    To process the generated (or provided) CSVs and get insights from Gemini:
    ```bash
    python enrich_with_gemini.py
    ```
    This will create/update `user_details_enriched.csv` and `marketing_interactions_enriched.csv`.
    *(Note: This step makes live API calls and may take time and incur costs/consume free tier quota depending on the data size and your API plan).*

6.  **Open in Power BI:**
    *   Open Power BI Desktop.
    *   Connect to the `*_enriched.csv` files as data sources.
    *   Recreate the dashboard visuals as shown in the screenshots, or use a provided `.pbix` file if available.
    *   Ensure Power Query steps for parsing JSON and expanding columns are correctly applied as discussed during development.

## AI-Powered Insights Examples

*   **RFQ Analysis:** The Gemini API is used to parse free-text RFQ submissions to identify:
    *   `service_product_type`: e.g., "Sheet metal fabrication", "CNC machining"
    *   `implied_urgency`: e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low"
    *   `key_specifications`: e.g., ["aluminum 6061", "1000 pcs"]
    These are then visualized, for example, in the "Type and Urgency" treemap.

*   **User Feedback Sentiment:** (If implemented and data available) User comments can be analyzed for sentiment ("Positive", "Negative", "Neutral") and key themes.

## Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   Incorporate more advanced NLP tasks (e.g., topic modeling on RFQs).
*   Automate the data pipeline using cloud services.
*   Expand the dashboard with more detailed drill-through pages.
